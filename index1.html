-Portable computers, compact, lightweight units including a full character set keyboard and primarily intended as hosts for software that may be parameterized, such as laptops/desktops, smartphones/tablets, etc.
-Smart cards that can run multiple applications but are typically used for payment, travel, and secure area access.
-Mobile phones, telephony devices which can call from a distance through cellular networking technology.
